<p>El conjunto de datos sobre <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset">ictus</a> (<code>healthcare_dataset_stroke_data.csv</code>) está compueto por <span class="hl-pinkpastel"><strong>5110 observaciones</strong></span> (en este caso cada observación corresponde a un paciente) y de un total de <span class="hl-pinkpastel"><strong>12 variables</strong></span> (10 variables explicativas, una variable <code>id</code> que tomará el rol de identificador y la variable objetivo <code>stroke</code>).</p>
<p><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>OBJETIVO</strong></span></p>
<p>Construir un modelo (varios en nuestro caso) para <span class="hl-pinkpastel"><strong>predecir la probabilidad de sufrir un ictus</strong></span> en función de algunas variables de entrada como el sexo, la edad, diversas enfermedades, el hábito de fumar y otras.</p>

<p>También es importante <strong>estandarizar los nombres de las variables de nuestro dataset</strong>. En general se puede ver que el dataset viene bastante bien preparado ya que no contiene espacios pero si que tiene <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase">UpperCamelCase</a> por lo que deberemos convertir las variables a minúsculas.</p>

<p>Como podemos observar nuestra variable objetivo <strong>Attrition</strong> tiene un 88.13% - 11.87% entre los dos valores que puede obtener, lo que nos indica que es una variable que está muy desbalanceada. A la hora de entrenar los modelos, esto va a tener repercusiones negativas haciendo que no haya buenas predicciones de cuando un empleado vaya a abandonar la empresa.</p>
<p>Para solucionar este problema se buscará una técnica tras realizar el análisis del resto de los datos para compensar esta falta de datos en el <strong>1-Yes</strong> de la variable objetivo.</p>

<p>La variable denominada <strong>maritalstatus</strong> indica el estado civil del empleado, concretamente puede ser <strong>Single</strong>, <strong>Married</strong> o <strong>Divorced</strong>. Se va a estudiar si esta variable puede llegar a ser simplificada a una variable dicotómica en la que se exprese únicamente si el empleado está casado o no.</p>
<p>En primer lugar vamos a ver si existe alguna variable que tenga pocos datos y por tanto pueda juntarse con otra, por ejemplo juntar <strong>Single</strong> con <strong>Divorced</strong> ya que no tendrían pareja.</p>

<p>Observamos que la distribución de esta variable no muestra ningún desbalance en los datos por lo que de momento no se podrá hacer la operación de juntar los campos mencionados anteriormente.</p>
<p><strong>Vamos a relacionar maritalstatus con la variable objetivo para buscar si se podría hacer esta agrupación.</strong></p>
<p>Viendo la relación que se establece entre la variable del abandono del trabajo (variable objetivo) y el estado civil, se va a poder deducir finalmente si la variable podría modificarse o no a una dicotómica que represente si el empleado tiene o no pareja.</p>

<p>Se puede apreciar que la variable <strong>Single</strong> no tiene un porcentaje parecido a la de <strong>Divorced</strong> por lo que es mejor mantener separadas estas variables ya que aportan una información diferente.</p>
<p>La mayor tasa de abandono del trabajo en función del estado civil se da cuando el empleado está soltero sin haberse casado anteriormente.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>Variable <em>jobrole</em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>La variable denominada <strong>jobrole</strong> representa el rol actual que cumple el empleado dentro de la empresa. Se trata de una variable que deberá ser convertida a categórica más adelante tras visualizar el resto de datos. Los valores que puede tomar son <strong>Nurse</strong>,<strong>Therapist</strong>,<strong>Administrative</strong>,<strong>Admin</strong> y <strong>Other</strong>.</p>

<p>Se va a estudiar si los datos categorizados como <strong>Admin</strong> y como <strong>Administrative</strong> pueden llegar a representar el mismo tipo de empleado.</p>
<p>En primer lugar se va a calcular el salario medio por rol para contemplar si los salarios son parecidos, en caso de serlos, podríamos seguir con la hipótesis de que se trata del mismo rol.</p>

<p>Todas estas categorías representan diferentes ámbitos dentro del mundo laboral y formativo, pero pueden ser <strong>agrupadas de una forma más simple</strong>. Esta forma es el <strong>tipo de ciencia o itinerario</strong> al que pertenecen.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, las personas formadas en <strong>Recursos Humanos</strong> y <strong>Marketing</strong>, comparten su formación en ciencias sociales ya que para cursar grados o ciclos formativos de estos estudios se necesita normalmente formación previa en un itinerario orientado a las ciencias sociales.</p>
<p>Ocurre lo mismo con las categorías <strong>Medical</strong> y <strong>Life Sciences</strong>. Estas pueden juntarse en una sola categoría ya que a pesar de la amplitud del campo de la medicina, esta sigue siendo parte de las ciencias biológicas.</p>

<p>A la hora de <strong>analizar las variables numéricas</strong> es muy importante también <strong>considerar el tratamiento de outliers</strong> en las mismas. Se van a revisar las diferentes variables numéricas para conocer aquellas que requieren o no del tratamiento de outliers.</p>
<p>En primer lugar se van a <strong>identificar aquellas variables que no son numéricas por definición</strong>. En nuestro dataset, existen diferentes variables que a pesar de ser numéricas representan realmente categorías, estas variables son las siguientes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>Variable <em>joblevel</em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>La variable <strong>joblevel</strong> representa el nivel del empleado en la empresa. Este nivel está ligado al escalafón de la propia empresa. Siendo <strong>1 el nivel más bajo y 5 el más alto</strong>.</p>
<p>Se trata de una variable que realmente no es numérica ya que tiene un número definido de categorías entre las cuales se pueden mover los diferentes empleados.</p>

<p>Con esta gráfica podemos deducir que la distribución de <strong>totalworkingyears</strong> presenta asimetría y valores outliers.</p>
<p>Por otro lado la distribución de <strong>trainingtimelastyear</strong> es simétrica aunque observamos que los valores bajos tienen mucha mayor variabilidad respecto a la mediana. En esta gráfica también encontramos ciertos valores outliers por lo que se deberá hacer un tratamiento de esta variable de la misma forma que de <strong>totalworkingyears</strong>.</p>

<p>Podemos observar como existe una mayor tasa de abandono laboral por parte de las mujeres (la tasa en mujeres supone un 12.01% de diferencia respecto a los hombres).</p>
<p>Otro aspecto interesante a observar en función de nuestra variable objetivo puede ser el departamento. Así se podrá conocer el departamento en el que más abandono laboral se produce dentro de la empresa.</p>

<p>El departamento en el que más abandono laboral se produce es el de <strong>cardiología</strong> y en el que menos con bastante diferencia es el de <strong>neurología</strong>. Por lo que interpretando estos datos, podría haber peores condiciones laborales en el departamento de cardiología.</p>
<p>Por último, respecto a las variables que originalmente eran de tipo character, se va a observar también la relación de la variable objetivo con la variable <strong>overtime</strong></p>

<p>Podemos observar que la mayoría de los empleados viven a una distancia muy corta del trabajo y a medida que esta distancia aumenta el número de empleados disminuye. Tambíen es destacable que en la distancia más lejana hay un leve aumento de empleados.</p>
<p>Por otro lado los empleados con <strong>Muy corta</strong> o <strong>Corta</strong> distancia al trabajo tienen una menor tasa de abandono <strong>(9.2% - 9.48%)</strong>. A medida que la distancia aumenta, la tasa de abandono también lo hace y los empleados que tienen una <strong>Muy lejana</strong> distancia tienen la mayor tasa de abandono <strong>(20.83%)</strong>, lo que sugiere que una mayor distancia al trabajo podría estar relacionada con un mayor desgaste y mayor rotación laboral.</p>

<p>En el <strong>joblevel</strong> podemos detectar como la gente que menos nivel tiene dentro de la propia empresa es la más propensa a abandonar el trabajo y conforme suben de nivel se va reduciendo hasta una tasa muy inferior a la inicial como es 2.47%</p>
<p>En cuanto a los turnos, es destacable que la gente que tiene su propia agenda <strong>(0 - Employees with own schedule)</strong> es la que tiene una mayor tasa de abandono labora, seguida eso sí, del turno de noche <strong>(3 - 9pm to 7am)</strong></p>

<p>En esta gráfica podemos ver como los empleados que han estado en pocas compañías tienen una tasa de abandono bastante alta <strong>(13.71%)</strong>, aun así, los que más abandono tienen son los que han estado en más trabajos <strong>(16.03%)</strong>. Esto sugiere que aquellos que han cambiado de empresa frecuentemente en el pasado tienen más probabilidades de abandonar su trabajo actual.</p>

<p>Se puede observar como existe una tasa de abandono laboral bastante similar en todos los niveles por lo que parece que la variable <strong>percentsalaryhike</strong> puede no estar aportando mucha información a nuestra variable objetivo. Para comprobar si realmente es útil posteriormente se realizará un contraste de independencia viendo si tiene sentido o no mantener esta variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>Variable <em>totalworkingyears</em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Para relacionar la variable objetivo con la variable <strong>totalworkingyears</strong> y previendo una posible distribución irregular en la que existen pocos empleados en ciertas franjas de experiencia como pueden ser los muy experimentados, se ha seleccionado el método de Dalenius-Hodges.</p>

<p>Podemos observar que la mayoría de empleados son Mid/Junior y a partir de esta franja, el numero de empleados comienza a descender hasta la menor tasa en los mas seniors donde es tan solo un <strong>9.07%</strong>.</p>
<p>Por otro lado en cuanto a la relación de la variable objetivo con el numero de años trabajados, se observa que los empleados más juniors son los que más tasa de abandono laboral tienen con un <strong>27.7%</strong> y los más seniors los que menos con un <strong>3.29%</strong>.</p>

<p>Para la variable <strong>trainingtimeslastyear</strong> también se usará Dalenius dado que la distribución de esta variable es sesgada o discontinua y por tanto los percentiles no harían una división correcta.</p>

<p>Observamos como las gráficas son bastante similares en cuanto a su tendencia descendente en función del paso de los años.</p>
<p>Los empleados que llevan menos tiempo en la compañía son los que tienen una mayor tasa de abandono laboral (<strong>23.01%</strong>), además se observa como en función del paso de los años esta tasa desciende hasta un <strong>2.46%</strong>.</p>
<p>Por otro lado los empleados que menos tiempo llevan con un manager son los que más abandonan el trabajo con un <strong>19.27%</strong> y esta tasa desciende a lo largo de los años a pesar de un pequeño incremento en el percentil 50-75 hasta el <strong>2.3%</strong> final</p>

<p>Se ve como la tasa de abandono se mantiene descendente a lo largo de los años. Los empleados que menos tiempo llevan en su rol o con su manager concreto son los que mas tendencia tienen a abandonar el empleo con un <strong>19.27% y 18.49%</strong> respectivamente.</p>
<p>Esta desciende notablemente hasta un <strong>2.3%</strong> en caso de los años en un rol y hasta un <strong>4.15%</strong> en los años con un manager concreto.</p>
<p>Con todas estas observaciones se puede deducir que existe una tendencia entre la gente más joven y que menos años lleva en el trabajo a abandonar ese empleo.</p>

<p>Este tipo de prueba se realiza sobre dos variables categóricas para comprobar si están o no relacionadas.</p>
<p>Vamos a ejecutar esta prueba sobre todas nuestras variables que pueden o son ya categóricas, por ello en primer lugar se van a convertir algunas variables a categóricas.</p>

<p>Gracias a los diferentes gráficos en el análisis de las variables se puede detectar que existen algunos valores extremos en nuestros datos. Para corregir esto, se va a realizar el tratamiento de los outliers en las variables que tienen estos valores.</p>
<p>Se ha podido observar que las variables que presentan valores atípicos son <strong>totalworkingyears</strong>, <strong>yearsatcompany</strong>, <strong>yearsincurrentrole</strong>, <strong>yearssincelastpromotion</strong>, <strong>yearswithcurrmanager</strong>, <strong>monthlyincome</strong>, <strong>numcompaniesworked</strong> y <strong>trainingtimeslastyear</strong></p>
<p>En alusión a los gráficos obtenidos en el análisis exploratorio de las variables podemos obervar que todas las distribuciones son asimétricas a excepción de la de la variable <strong>trainingtimeslastyear</strong> por lo que esta tendrá un tratamiento especial frente al resto.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>Variable <em>trainingtimeslastyear</em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Como se ha mencionado anteriormente, <strong>trainingtimeslastyear</strong> posee una distribución simétrica por lo que se va a realizar la imputación respecto a la media.</p>

<p>A pesar de encontrar outliers de forma gráfica, podemos observar que <strong>respecto a la media</strong> y estableciendo un valor de <strong>K = 3</strong>, no existen unos valores tan extremos como para ser considerados outliers por lo que no se realizará el tratamiento de esta variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="hl-bluepastel"><strong>Variables <em>asimétricas</em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Para realizar el tratamiento de los outliers de estas variables asimétricas no se puede imputar por la media por lo que consideraremos realizarlo respecto a la mediana.</p>
<p>Para poder realizar una detección de outliers respecto a la mediana primero nos tenemos que asegurar que las medianas de nuestras variables sean diferentes a 0 por lo que se van a realizar estos calculos a continuación:</p>

<p>Observamos que ninguna de estas variables posee una mediana = 0 por lo que podemos continuar con nuestro proceso normalmente.</p>
<p>Respecto a la mediana asignaremos <strong>K = 3</strong> inicialmente. Por tanto un dato atípico en nuestro análisis será aquel que se aleje 3 veces de la mediana de las desviaciones absolutas.</p>
<p>Por cada una de las variables habrá una variable outlier respectiva que contendrá 0 o 1 en función de si es o no outlier.</p>

<p>En primer lugar vamos a visualizar la distribución de las diferentes variables al aplicar el proceso de winzoricación para comprobar su utilidad.</p>

<p>Podemos ver que el modelo tiene muy buen <strong>acuraccy</strong> y <strong>specificity</strong> ya que la mayoría de nuestros datos son 0’s y por tanto los clasificamos muy bien.</p>
<p>El problema de este modelo viene a la hora de clasificar los 1’s que es lo que realmente nos interesa; y es que como no hay casi representación de esta clase, métricas como el <strong>AUC</strong> y la <strong>sensibilidad</strong>, son muy malas.</p>
<p>Como se ha mencionado anteriormente, el modelo tiene una distribución de la variable <strong>target</strong> muy desbalanceada, esto nos ha llevado a obtener malos resultados en el modelo por lo que se va a llevar a cabo el empleo de la técnica de oversampling para añadir datos que representen el valor que queremos predecir.</p>

<p>El <strong>oversampling</strong> complementar los datos de entrenamiento con múltiples copias de algunas de las clases minoritarias, en nuestro caso añadirá muestras de 1’s en la variable <strong>attrition</strong></p>
<p>Previamente la variable objetivo estaba distribuida de la siguiente forma:</p>

<p>Observamos que se ha reducido tanto el accuracy como el specificity en estos nuevos modelos, aun así, gracias a ampliar nuestra muestra de personas que abandonaban la empresa, ahora también predice mejor esta casuística (<strong>sensitivity</strong>) por tanto en general los modelos son más completos y predicen mejor ambas clases, pero sobre todo los positivos que es lo que más nos interesa.</p>
<p>Vamos a observar los diferentes resultados de nuestro cross-validation para comparar los modelos en términos de sensibilidad.</p>

<p>Vamos a considerar como 🏆 <strong>modelo ganador</strong> 🏆 el primer modelo: <strong>0.5 - 0.001</strong>.</p>
<p>Este es el mejor modelo porque:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tiene la mediana y la media más altas (<strong>~0.94-0.95</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Existe poca variabilidad</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Por tanto los hiperparámetros de nuestro modelo ganador son <strong>minbucket = 0.5</strong> y <strong>complejidad de poda = 0.001</strong></p>

<p>En cuanto a nuestro modelo de árbol de decisión podemos decir que tiene una buena precisión, con un <strong>83.03%</strong> de <strong>accuracy</strong>, lo que indica que acierta en la mayoría de los casos. La <strong>sensibilidad</strong> ha mejorado notablemente respecto a la que se veía en el primer modelo, alcanzando <strong>67.5%</strong>, lo que refleja una mejor capacidad para detectar empleados que dejarán la empresa (ha empeorado en el conjunto de test pero esto es algo normal). El valor de <strong>specificity</strong> es alto (<strong>85.14%</strong>), lo que sugiere que el modelo identifica correctamente a aquellos empleados que no se van. Finalmente, el <strong>AUC</strong> de <strong>0.7762</strong> demuestra una capacidad razonable para distinguir entre las dos clases.</p>

<p>La <strong>receta</strong> es una serie de instrucciones que nos permite llevar a cabo diferentes <strong>transformaciones en los datos</strong>. Algunas de estas transformaciones son la asignación de roles; la recategorización de variables; el tratamiento de valores extremos o nulos; la estandarización de los datos por rango y/o normalización etc.</p>
<p>Es un proceso equivalente en muchos casos a la depuración de los datos que se ha hecho previamente, por lo que la receta que se va a desarrollar está orientada a unos datos que ya han sido tratados.</p>
<p>La receta que se construye <strong>prepara los datos para predecir la variable attrition</strong>, eliminando el identificador del conjunto de datos a la hora del modelado y el bake final, también <strong>agrupa categorías poco frecuentes</strong>, <strong>limpia variables redundantes o sin variación</strong>, <strong>escala valores numéricos</strong>, <strong>convierte categóricos a dummies</strong> y aplica oversampling para <strong>balancear la variable objetivo</strong> (attrition).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>En primer lugar vamos a definir el número de vecinos, tomará valores desde 100 hasta 500 de 100 en 100.</p></li>
<li><p>Definiremos también la función que va a emplear el kernel para promediar el peso</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inv</strong>: Promedio por el inverso de la distancia.</li>
<li><strong>Gaussian</strong>: Promedio según los puntos más cercanos al centro.</li>
<li><strong>Epanechnikov</strong>: Proporciona eficiencia y rendimiento.</li>
<li><strong>Biweight</strong>: Ignora a los vecinos mas alejados.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Parámetro dist, que decide el tipo de distancia, variable entre 1 y 2 (distancia Manhattan y Euclídea, respectivamente)</p></li>

<p>El modelo “100 - biweight - 2” es el mejor en esta comparativa.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sensibilidad más alta en mediana</strong>: es crucial para detectar bien los positivos (en este problema es lo que nos interesa).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Menor dispersión</strong>: predicciones estables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Los hiperparámetros de este modelo son 100 como número de vecinos, biweight como función que utilice el kernel para promediar los pesos y distancia euclídea.</p>
<p>Por tanto el 🏆 <strong>modelo ganador</strong> 🏆 es el de la combinación <code>k = 100</code> + <code>weight_func = "biweight"</code> + <code>dist = 2</code></p>
